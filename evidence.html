    <p>Since I started receiving the transfers, my daily income has improved. What I used to pay daily for the motorcycle loan, I can now use for other needs. The goat business is also supporting me well, complementing the motorcycle income and making my earnings more stable. My family is doing well, and I am now able to pay school fees without struggling, unlike before when it was very difficult. These changes have really eased my life and brought peace of mind.</p>

    <p>Since I started receiving the transfer, my life has really improved. I can now pay school fees for my children and comfortably manage rent because my business profits have increased. I am also able to send a little money to support my mum, something I couldn’t do before. These changes have made my family happier and given me peace of mind.</p>

    <p>Since I improved my business, I have had to reach out to more clients because I have a variety of products now, thus increased income levels. This is the biggest difference in my life since receiving this money.</p>

    <p>Taking care of my family has become a significant burden for me. I rely solely on casual jobs, and as I grow older, the physical toll of these construction jobs has taken a serious toll on my body. I am a mother of six children: four are in college, and two are in secondary school. Additionally, I live with my elderly mother, who is unable to care for herself and depends on me as well. Currently, my children have an outstanding school fee balance of $18,000, which adds to my stress. I hold onto the hope that once they finish college, they will find jobs to help support our household.</p>

    <p>Hand to mouth is the kind of life I am living with some days going the whole day without any meal. My husband and I do casual jobs, making approximately $150 per month. The money caters to food and school fees for the children. This is not enough. Thus, my six children have missed school this term for almost two weeks now due to the school fees balance of $60. I feel unhappy seeing my children at home while they are supposed to be at school. This program has come to make me achieve my desire to do commercial crop farming
